* Slip
** What it is
   Slip is a (family of) simple Lisp interpreters that I'm working on
   to get a better understanding of interpreters as a whole. So far
   it's been a lot of fun!
** Slip-1
   The first in the Slip family will, appropriately, be a Lisp-1. I'm
   basically attempting to implement an ever-larger subset of Scheme
   here. ~(joke "Continuations are a *long* way off")~
